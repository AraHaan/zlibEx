# zlibEx

![zlib Extended](https://i.gyazo.com/87a5b318e3ddc447d8008292ac44f835.png)

A DLL made in C++ 6 and now also for C++ 2005 Express as well (2005 uses up to date libxml though as I could not do so in C++ 6).



# Requirements
*	C++ 6 (for building for Visual Studio 6).
*	C++ 2005 Express (For not building for Visual Studio 6).
*	MFC installed on both. (optional)

# Other
to build libogg I had to copy some of the MFC Header fiels from C++ 6 to the project folder for 8 on it.
So use that if you dont have MFC for it. if you do then you can remove those files.
